# Transpose of given matrix
## Statement
Given a matrix L of dimmensions M * N. print the transpose of the matrix.
## Input
* first line contains space seperated positive integers M and N.
* following M lines with each line having space seperated N integers.
## Constraints 
* 1 <= M,N <= 10<sup>6</sup>.
* every element of matrix is in [ -10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup> ]
## Sample input 
```
3 4 
23 34 33 78
45 62 57 39 
12 3 56 89
```
## Sample output
```
23 45 12 
34 62 3
33 57 56
78 39 89
```
## Explanation
* we can observe that the transpose of given 3 x 4 matrix is above printed 4 x 3 matrix.
