# Dot product of two vectors
## Statement
Given two vectors of N dimensions print their dot product.
## Input
* first line gives the no.of testcases T.
* each testcases has three lines containg:
* A line has positive integer N.
* followed by 2 lines of N real numbers (space seperated).
## Constraints 
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 1000
every element of vector is in range [ -10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup> ]
## Sample input 
```
2
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
2
1 2
6 7
```
## Sample output
```
32
20
```
## Explanation
* dot product of vectors <1,2,3> and <4,5,6> is 32.
* dot product of vectors <1,2> and <6,7> is 20.
