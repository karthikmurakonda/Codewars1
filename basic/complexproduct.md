# Product of complex numbers
## Statement
Find the product of given two complex numbers (a1+ib1) and (a2+ib2) .
## Input
Variables a1 , b1 , c1 ,d1 -> a1 and b1 are the real and complex parts of the first complex no. and a2 and b2 for the second complex no. respectively.
## Constraints 
1<=a1,b1,a2,b2<=100
## Output 
The code must display the resultant complex no. after multiplication in the format of a+ib .

If imaginary part is 0 then, print only a.

If real part is 0 then, print only ib .
## Sample input 
```
4
5
4
-5
```
## Sample output
```
41
```
## Explanation
This is just basic complex no. multiplication which is widely used in the Argand plane in Maths.
