# Matrix Multiplication
## Statement
Given two 3x3 matrices, find their product and store it in a seperate matrix. Now, print this matrix
there are three lines of input for each matrix
each line of input contains three space seperated integers
next three lines are input for the next matrix.
## Constraints
-10<sup>6</sup><=N<=10<sup>6</sup>, where N is the element of the matrix.
## Sample Input
```
2 3 4
1 2 3
-1 1 2
1 3 0
-1 2 1
0 0 2
```
## Sample Output
```
-1 12 11
-1 7 8
-2 -1 5
```
