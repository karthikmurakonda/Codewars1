# Number of trailing zeros
## Statement
Find the number of trailing zeros in the product of all even numbers in range[1,N] .
## Input
first line contains no.of test cases **T**
each Test case contains a line having **N**
## Constraints 
1 <= N <= 2*10<sup>4</sup>
## Sample input 
```
2
5
16
```
## Sample output
```
0
1
```
## Explanation
* Even numbers between 1,5 are 2,4 whose product is 2*4 i.e 8 which doesn't have any trailing zero.so, output should be 0.
* Even numbers between 1,16 are 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16 whose produt is 10321920 which have one trailing zero.so, output should be 1.
